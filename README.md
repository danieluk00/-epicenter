Epicenter is an experimental mapping web app we created at the Le Wagon Coding bootcamp. It coordinates the organising of an event where the meeting place is algorithmically determined from the locations of the people joining.

It's built on Rails with a Ruby backend and JS/HTML front end, and makes use of the Google Places API and Mapbox.

You can try it out at http://www.epicenter.live/

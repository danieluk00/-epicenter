Epicenter is a gamified mapping web app we created at the Le Wagon Coding bootcamp. It lets a group of friends create and join an event and share the location each person is travelling from. The algorithm then calculates the centre point of all attendees and recommends a nearby venue (bar, cafe or restaurant) for the group to meet.

It's built on Rails with a Ruby backend and JS/HTML front end, and makes use of the Google Places API and Mapbox.
